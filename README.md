## [⭐ What is it? ⭐]

**For No Reason** is a playful and competitive app where users are randomly assigned to leagues every **day**, **week**, and **month**.

The twist?  
It’s not about skill.  
It’s not about grinding.  
It’s all about **luck**.

Each day is a new chance to climb the ranks — or fall back down. The **luckiest** users rise to the top, and some of them even get **rewarded**.

🛠️ *Currently in active development.*
